## Goals

- Develop a functional webpage with basic gardening features.
- Implement user authentication for secure access.
- Create a database to store user and garden data.
- Add interactive elements to enhance user experience.
- Balance game numbers to avoid optimal/solved strategies, and add randomness factors.
